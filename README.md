Questions we want to answer:

1) What is the distribution of bank account ownership like across different states / territories? Are there any correlations with education level, urbanization rates, etc.?
2) Are there any significant rural - urban divides in terms of financial inclusion?
3) Are there any interesting correlations between labor force demographics and financial inclusion across states / territories?
4) What relationship exists between financial inclusion metrics (account ownership, saving and borrowing behavior, credit access, digital payment adoption, mobile money usage, etc.)
5) Which demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, education, etc.) are the strongest predictors of financial inclusion? (TBD: not sure how much individual-level data exists to answer this.)
6) How do savings and borrowing behaviors differ across income groups, education levels, and states / territories? Across communities?
7) Are there any correlations between financial inclusion / economic opportunity and urban trends (e.g. digital payment incentives, gentrification)?
8) Are there any interesting relationships between infrastructure (e.g. access to electricity, internet access, use of mobile phones) and financial inclusion?
9) What relationships exist between access to credit, credit usage, etc. and small business ownership and entrepreneurship?
